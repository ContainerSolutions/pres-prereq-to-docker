# Prerequisites to Docker 
## Docker in organizations
Note:
- Sharing experience of my last months of work: delta soft skills > delta technical skills
- How many people are here to get an answer to the question "is Docker a tool for me?", or do you already know the answer to that?

## "Is Docker for me?"
### ... for us?

## Developer
### & Docker

Note:
My experience up to Container Solutions has mostly been with developers, at this meetup etc. And developers usually are pretty enthusiatic about Docker!

Note: Developers van have a bit of a tunnel vision. It is easy to assume that all parts in the organisation will be as enthusiatic as the dev, however...

Note: Docker just might not be a perfect fit for an organisation in a certain state, leaving managers with a headache.

## IT in a company
- Supportive use of software <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Software as key <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Note: interest in companies or projects that have software a key value. Developing it and delivering/selling it.

### Will Docker help?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Note:
- TTM is a key concept. Reducing TTM will result in value. Happy sales, happy scrum masters, happy CEOs, etc. 
- Question is, will Docker help you with that? So, this brings us from "Is Docker for me?" to "Is Docker for us?"
